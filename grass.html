        <h3>Japanese Stiltgrass</h3>
        <h4>Genus/species: <i>Microstegium vimineum</i></h4>
        <p><b>Description:</b>  Japanese Stiltgrass is an annual grass with slender stalks that create a sprawling posture. Identifying characteristics include lance-shaped leaves 4” to 5” long and ½” wide with a prominent midrib. It is a prolific seed producer.  Seeds can survive in the soil for 5 years. It can invade a wide variety of habitats including heavily shaded forests. It may have detrimental effect on several butterfly species by crowding out native plants the butterflies depend upon. To control this grass, individual plants can be easily pulled since they are annuals and shallowly rooted.  If the plants have gone to seed, they need to be removed from the site. If they do not have seeds they can be placed in piles.  Also, mowing can effectively control the grass after it has flowered but before it goes to seed in August.  Chemical application has to be controlled to protect desirable natives in the area.</p>

        <h3>Johnson Grass</h3>
        <h4>Genus/species: <i>Sorghum halepense</i></h4>
        <p><b>Description:</b>  Johnson Grass is a tall, coarse grass with a stout root system. It grows in dense clumps reaching up to 8’ high. Identifying characteristics include smooth leaves that are 6” to 20” long.  A whitish midvein of the leaf is characteristic of this plant.  Stems near the base are pink to rusty red. The purplish and hairy flowers are in loosely branched clusters (panicles). The reddish brown seeds are nearly 1⁄8” long. Dense patches can be controlled with an herbicide applied by walking backwards to avoid walking through the wet herbicide.</p>
