        <h1>White Mulberry</h1>
        <h2>Genus/species:  Malus alba</h2>
        <p>Description:  White Mulberry is a deciduous tree that grows up to 40 feet tall. The tree’s younger bark is bright orange and the older bark is gray. This tree invades forest edges, disturbed forests, and open areas, displacing native species.  It is replacing our native red mulberry through hybridization and theoretically through transmission of a harmful root disease. Identifying characteristics include simple, glossy lance-like, alternate leaves that are flat and broad, lobed or not lobed. Male and female flowers are on separate plants.  The small green male flowers occur in 1 to 2 inch elongated cluster (catkins); female flowers are crowded in short spikes. The cylindrical, 1” to 1½” fruit form from the female flowers and resemble blackberries. During ripening these change color from white to pink to black in late summer.  A single tree can produce an estimated twenty million seeds! Seedlings can be pulled by hand.  Large trees must be removed by cutting the tree and using an appropriate herbicide to treat the cut stump or girdling the trunk and painting the cut surface with an herbicide.</p>
