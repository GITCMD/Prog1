      <p class="w"><b>This project is a resource for forest volunteers to become familiar with the identifying characteristics of the invasive plants they are helping to remove.</b><br></p>       
      <p class="w"><br><b> Most of the invasive plants were brought to this country as ornamental plants.  These plants use the environment in a way that pushes out the native plants either by blocking the resources like shade or attaching to them like vines and killing them. The plant below is the lesser celandine and its ground cover is shown as an example of its invasive nature.</b><br></p>
      <p class="w"><br><b>Click on the links above and each page has a photos of the plants which when click will show enlargements of the parts of the plant.  The photos can be clicked again on an area of interest for further enlargement.Hit the back button to return to the page. A description of the plant follows each plant photo.</b></p>
